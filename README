closestDOMS creates a list of the charges and distances of DOMS within a certain radius of the path 
of the most energetic muon or if there is no muon, the  most energetic particle in the MC tree
There are two lists for charges, and two lists for distances (perpendicular to particle path)
One list is for DOMS in DC, the other is for DOMS outside of DC
Deep Core DOM lists are labeled with DC, others are labeled with Veto

Complies thusly:
g++ `icetray-config icetray phys-services dataclasses dataio` closestDOMS.cxx -o closestDOMS 


runs thusly:
./closestDOMS 250.0 input.i3 output.i3 OfflinePulses
radius is 250m
runs on input file
returns output file
runs over pulses in OfflinePulses
